# ManageUp User Guide

Sick of spreadsheets, scattered documents and switching between multiple tools? 

ManageUp is an **employee and task management application** designed for **managers overseeing multiple teams or departments**. It is
optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, while still providing the benefits of a
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. ManageUp offers a **centralised** and **streamlined** approach to managing employee
data, including contact details, positions, departments, and assigned tasks.

## Who is this guide for?

<box type="definition" seamless>

ManageUp is built for **managers overseeing multiple teams or departments** who:

* Prefer typing commands over navigating menus
* Need one place to track employee contact details, departments, positions, and tasks
* May work offline — ManageUp requires no internet connection

**Assumed knowledge:** Basic comfort with using CLI and Terminal (e.g. `cd`, `java -jar`).

</box>

**Key features:**
* Manage employee records — [`add`](#adding-an-employee-add), [`edit`](#editing-an-employee-edit), [`delete`](#deleting-an-employee-delete) employees and their details
* Filter employees by name, department, position, tag, or task — [`show`](#showing-filtered-employees-show)
* Assign and track tasks per employee — [`addtask`](#adding-a-task-addtask), [`edittask`](#editing-a-task-edittask), [`deletetask`](#deleting-a-task-deletetask), [`cleartasks`](#clearing-all-tasks-for-an-employee-cleartasks)
* Works fully offline — no internet connection required

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. ManageUp requires **Java 17 or above**. You can check your Java version by running:

   ```
   java -version
   ```

   If the version shown is **17 or above**, skip to Step 2. Otherwise, install Java 17:

   | Operating System  | How to install                                                                                                           |
   |-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Windows**       | Follow the installation guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html).            |
   | **Mac**           | Install the **exact JDK version** prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html). |
   | **Linux**         | Follow the installation guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html)               |

2. Download the latest `ManageUp.jar` from the ManageUp Github [releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/releases). 

3. Save the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for ManageUp.

4. Open Terminal or Command Prompt and navigate to the folder containing `ManageUp.jar` using `cd`, then launch the app with `java -jar ManageUp.jar`.

   For example, if you saved `ManageUp.jar` in your **Downloads** folder:

   | OS | Commands to run |
   |----|------------------|
   | **Windows** | `cd C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Downloads` <br> `java -jar ManageUp.jar` |
   | **Mac / Linux** | `cd ~/Downloads` <br> `java -jar ManageUp.jar` |

   Replace `Downloads` with the name of your chosen folder if different.

5. ManageUp opens with sample data, as shown below. 

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Type commands in the command box at the top and press **Enter** to execute them. Some commands to try:

   * `list` — lists all employees
   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com d/IT pos/Software Engineer` — adds an employee
   * `show d/IT` — filters employees in the IT department
   * `addtask 1 task/Prepare Report desc/Submit by Friday` — adds a task to employee at index 1
   * `exit` — exits the app

7. Refer to [Features](#features) for full details of each command, or [Command Summary](#command-summary) for a quick reference.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* All commands and parameters are case-sensitive. For example, `add` is a valid command but `ADD` is not. Similarly, `n/NAME` is valid but `N/NAME` is not.

* Parameters can be in any order unless specified.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If you type extra text after commands like `help`, `list`, `exit`, or `clear`, ManageUp will ignore it.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<a id="email-format"></a>
<box type="info" seamless>

**Valid email format:**

An email must follow the format `local-part@domain` and adhere to these rules:
- The local-part may contain alphanumeric characters and `+`, `_`, `.`, `-`, but cannot start or end with these special characters.
- The domain must be at least 2 characters long.
- Each domain label must start and end with alphanumeric characters, and may only contain hyphens in between (e.g. `my-domain.com`).
- The total length must not exceed 100 characters.
- Emails are compared case-insensitively.

</box>

<a id="viewing-help"></a>
### Viewing help : `help`

Shows an in-app help window with supported commands, allowed inputs, and examples.

Format: `help`

#### Overview

When you enter `help`, ManageUp opens a separate help window inside the app.

The help window gives a quick summary of:

* supported commands
* the allowed input format for each command
* one or more examples you can follow directly

This is useful when you want a quick reminder without scrolling through the full User Guide.

#### Command usage

`help` does not require any additional parameters.

If you type extra text after `help`, ManageUp will still interpret it as `help`.

The help window displays a compact command reference and a button that copies the online User Guide URL to your
clipboard so you can open the full guide in a browser if needed.

After entering `help`, ManageUp opens the Help Window shown below.

![Help Window](images/Help_PopOutWindow.png)

#### Important notes

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use `help` when you forget a command format or want a quick example before trying a command.
</box>

* The help window is intended as a quick reference. The full User Guide still contains more detailed explanations and examples.


#### Examples

* `help`
  Opens the in-app Help Window.


<a id="adding-an-employee"></a>
### Adding an employee: `add`

Adds a new employee to ManageUp.

Format:
```
add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL d/DEPARTMENT pos/POSITION [t/TAG]...
```

* Only `TAG` is optional. All other parameters must be provided.
* Duplicate prefixes for `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `d/`, and `pos/` are not allowed.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If you provide duplicate tags in the same command (e.g. `t/intern t/intern`), ManageUp will treat them as one — only a single tag will be saved.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Parameter constraints for this command:**

| Parameter | Length         | Allowed Characters                                                    |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NAME`    | 1–100 characters  | Alphanumeric characters, hyphens (`-`), apostrophes (`'`), and spaces |
| `PHONE`   | 3–15 digits    | Numbers only                                                          |
| `EMAIL`   | 1–100 characters  | Follows [valid email format](#email-format)                           |
| `DEPARTMENT` | 1–100 characters | Alphanumeric characters and spaces only                            |
| `POSITION`  | 1–100 characters | Alphanumeric characters and spaces only                             |
| `TAG`     | 1–50 characters   | Alphanumeric characters only                                          |

</box>


<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** Duplicate employees are not allowed. An employee is considered a duplicate if they share the same name as an existing employee, and also share the same phone number or the same email address (or both). Any attempt to add a duplicate employee will be rejected.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** Phone numbers must be unique across all employees. Adding a duplicate phone number will be rejected and will show which existing employee owns it.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** Email addresses must be unique across all employees and are compared case-insensitively. Adding a duplicate email will be rejected and will show which existing employee owns it.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use tags as flexible labels — e.g. `t/onLeave`, `t/MC`, `t/probation`, `t/mentor`. An employee can have any number of tags (including none).

</box>


#### Examples

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com d/IT pos/Software Engineer` – adds an employee with no tags.
* `add n/Betsy Crowe p/91234567 e/betsycrowe@example.com d/HR pos/Recruiter t/fulltime` – adds an employee with one tag.
* `add n/Jacob Smith p/87763456 e/jacob@example.com d/Finance pos/Marketer t/intern t/partTime` – adds an employee with multiple tags.

After entering a valid `add` command, ManageUp confirms the new employee was added. The new employee appears at the bottom of the full employee list.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Expected output:**
![Add employee success](images/AddEmployee_Successful.png)

</box>

### Listing all employees : `list`

Shows a list of all employees in the address book.

Format: `list`

### Showing filtered employees: `show`

Shows employees that match one or more field-based filters.

**Format:**  
`show [n/NAME_KEYWORD...] [d/DEPARTMENT_KEYWORD...] [p/PHONE_KEYWORD...] [e/EMAIL_KEYWORD...] [pos/POSITION_KEYWORD...] [t/TAG_KEYWORD...] [task/TASK_KEYWORD...]`

##### How it works

The `show` command filters the employee list using the prefixes you provide.

A prefix refers to a field of an employee:
- `n/` for name
- `d/` for department
- `p/` for phone
- `e/` for email
- `pos/` for position
- `t/` for tag
- `task/` for task

You must provide **at least one** filter. If no filter is given, the command is invalid.

##### Matching behaviour

`show` uses **case-insensitive substring matching** for all supported fields.

This means:
- matching is **not case-sensitive**
- partial keywords are allowed
- a match is found as long as the keyword appears anywhere inside the field value

For example:
- `n/al` can match `Alex`, `Sally`, or `ALAN`
- `d/it` can match `IT`
- `e/gmail` can match `alex@gmail.com`
- `pos/engineer` can match `Software Engineer`
- `t/mentor` can match a tag such as `mentor`
- `task/report` can match a task such as `Prepare report`

##### Different prefixes: AND behaviour

When you provide **different prefixes**, they are combined using **AND**.

This means an employee must satisfy **all** of those filters to be shown.

For example:
- `show n/Alex d/IT` shows only employees whose name contains `Alex` **and** whose department contains `IT`
- `show d/HR pos/Manager` shows only employees whose department contains `HR` **and** whose position contains `Manager`
- `show t/fulltime task/report` shows only employees who have a tag containing `fulltime` **and** a task containing `report`

So the more different fields you add, the narrower the result becomes.

##### Multiple keywords under the same prefix: OR behaviour

When a single prefix is followed by **multiple keywords**, those keywords are treated as **OR** within that field.

This means an employee only needs to match **one** of those keywords for that field.

For example:
- `show n/John Alex` shows employees whose name contains `John` **or** `Alex`
- `show d/HR Finance` shows employees whose department contains `HR` **or** `Finance`
- `show t/mentor fulltime` shows employees who have a tag containing `mentor` **or** `fulltime`

If this is combined with other prefixes, the OR logic applies within that field, while different fields are still combined using AND.

For example:
- `show n/John Alex d/IT` shows employees whose name contains `John` **or** `Alex`, **and** whose department contains `IT`
- `show t/mentor fulltime task/report` shows employees who have a tag containing `mentor` **or** `fulltime`, **and** a task containing `report`

##### Order of filters

Filters can be written in **any order**.

For example, the following commands are treated the same:
- `show n/Alex d/IT`
- `show d/IT n/Alex`

##### Supported keyword format

Each prefix can be followed by **one or more keywords**.

Each keyword is matched separately using substring matching.

For example:
- `show n/John Alex` checks whether the employee’s name contains `John` or `Alex`
- `show pos/Engineer Manager` checks whether the employee’s position contains `Engineer` or `Manager`

Since matching is based on substrings, shorter keywords are often enough.

For example:
- `show pos/Engineer` may already match `Software Engineer`
- `show d/Fin` may match `Finance`
- `show task/report` may match `Prepare report`
- `show t/lead` may match `teamlead`

##### Notes
- At least one filter must be provided.
- Filters are case-insensitive.
- All matching is based on substring containment.
- Different prefixes are combined using **AND**.
- Multiple keywords under the same prefix are treated as **OR**.
- Filters can be written in any order.

#### Examples

- `show e/gmail`  
  Shows employees whose email contains `gmail`.

- `show pos/Engineer`  
  Shows employees whose position contains `Engineer`, such as `Software Engineer`.

- `show t/mentor`  
  Shows employees with a tag containing `mentor`.

- `show task/report`  
  Shows employees with a task containing `report`.

- `show n/John Alex`  
  Shows employees whose name contains `John` **or** `Alex`.

- `show d/HR Finance`  
  Shows employees whose department contains `HR` **or** `Finance`.

- `show t/mentor fulltime`  
  Shows employees with a tag containing `mentor` **or** `fulltime`.

- `show n/Alex pos/Manager`  
  Shows employees whose name contains `Alex` **and** whose position contains `Manager`.

- `show pos/Manager d/HR`  
  Shows employees whose position contains `Manager` **and** whose department contains `HR`.

- `show n/John Alex d/IT`  
  Shows employees whose name contains `John` **or** `Alex`, and whose department contains `IT`.

- `show t/intern task/report`  
  Shows employees with a tag containing `intern` **and** a task containing `report`.

<a id="editing-an-employee"></a>
### Editing an employee: `edit`

Edits the details of an existing employee identified by the employee index. Only fields you include are changed.

Format:
```
edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [d/DEPARTMENT] [pos/POSITION] [t/TAG]...
```

* `INDEX` refers to the employee index shown in the currently displayed employee list.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Duplicate prefixes for `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `d/`, and `pos/` are not allowed.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If you provide duplicate tags in the same command (e.g. `t/intern t/intern`), ManageUp will treat them as one — only a single tag will be saved.

<a id="deleting-an-employee"></a>
### Deleting an employee : `delete`

Deletes one or more specified employees from the address book.

Format: `delete NAME` or `delete INDEX [MORE_INDEXES]...`

#### Overview

The `delete` command supports two ways to remove employees:

* by `NAME`
* by one or more displayed `INDEX` values

Both forms operate on the **currently displayed employee list**.

This means the result depends on what is currently shown in the app window. For example, after a `show` command, the indexes
refer to the filtered list instead of the full list.

#### Command usage

##### Deleting by name

Use `delete NAME` when you want to remove an employee by name instead of list position.

* Name matching is **case-insensitive**.
* Extra spaces in the input are ignored.
* The entered name must match **one unique employee** in the currently displayed list.

For example, after entering `delete betsy Crowe`, ManageUp deletes the matching employee and shows a success message.

![Deleting an employee by name successfully](images/DeleteEmployee_ByName_Successful.png)

##### Deleting by index

Use `delete INDEX` when you want to remove one displayed employee by position in the current list.

* The index refers to the number shown in the currently displayed employee list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** such as `1`, `2`, or `3`.
* Index-based deletion is useful when multiple employees have similar or identical names.

For example, after entering `delete 2`, ManageUp deletes the 2nd displayed employee and shows a success message.

![Deleting an employee by index successfully](images/DeleteEmployee_ByIndex_Successful.png)

##### Batch deletion

You can delete several employees in one command by listing multiple indexes.

* Example format: `delete 1 3 5`
* Every index must be valid before ManageUp deletes any employee.
* The order of the indexes does not matter. For example, `delete 13 5 10` and `delete 5 10 13` are both valid as long as all the indexes exist in the currently displayed list.
* Duplicate indexes in the same command are not allowed. For example, `delete 1 2 2` is not valid because index `2` is duplicated.

This prevents partial deletion when one of the indexes is wrong.

For example, after entering `delete 1 2 3`, ManageUp deletes all three displayed employees and lists them in the success message.

![Batch deleting employees by index successfully](images/DeleteEmployee_BatchDeleteByIndex_Successful.png)

#### Important notes

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** If you want to delete from the full employee list again after using `show`, run `list` first so the indexes are
reset to the full list.
</box>

* `delete NAME` checks only the employees currently shown on screen.
* `delete INDEX` and batch delete also use the currently displayed list.
* If an invalid index is provided, no employee will be deleted.
* If no employee matches the given name, the command will fail.
* If the entered name contains invalid characters, the command will fail.

For example, entering `delete 100` fails because the provided index is invalid.

![Deleting with an invalid index](images/DeleteEmployee_Error_InvalidIndex.png)

For example, entering `delete max` fails because no displayed employee matches that name.

![Deleting by a name that does not exist](images/DeleteEmployee_Error_NameNotFound.png)

For example, entering `delete 1b#` fails because the name contains invalid characters.

![Deleting with an invalid name](images/DeleteEmployee_Error_InvalidName.png)

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** If more than one displayed employee has the same name, `delete NAME` will fail. In that case, use
`delete INDEX` instead.
</box>

For example, entering `delete john doe` fails because multiple displayed employees have the same name.

![Deleting by name when duplicate names exist](images/DeleteEmployee_Error_DuplicatedNames.png)

#### Examples

* `list` followed by `delete 2`
  Deletes the 2nd employee in the full employee list.

* `show d/HR` followed by `delete 1`
  Deletes the 1st employee in the filtered employee list.

* `list` followed by `delete 1 3 5`
  Deletes the 1st, 3rd, and 5th employees in the displayed employee list.

* `delete John Doe`
  Deletes the employee named `John Doe` if exactly one displayed employee matches that name.

<a id="adding-a-task-to-an-employee"></a>
### Adding a task to an employee : `addtask`

Adds a task to a specific employee.

Format: `addtask EMPLOYEE_INDEX task/TASK_NAME desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION`

* `EMPLOYEE_INDEX` refers to the employee index shown in the currently displayed employee list.
* The task will be added to that employee's personal task list and shown on the employee card.
* The task will have an index number attached to it, to indicate task number.
* A task name between 1 and 40 characters and a task description between 1 and 120 characters must be provided.
* Only 1 `task/` and 1 `desc/` are allowed in the command. Duplicate prefixes are not allowed.
* The format and order of `task/` and `desc/` should be followed exactly as stated in the format and no field should be left out.
* `addtask` provides a warning message to the user with the specified format to remind users of the correct format if the command is invalid.
* `addtask 1 task/Prepare Report` is not valid because the description field is missing.

Examples:
* `addtask 2 task/Prepare Report desc/Submit by Friday` 
   adds a task named `Prepare Report` with description `Submit by Friday` to employee at index 2.
* `addtask 2 task/Client Followup desc/Call client before Monday` 
   adds a task named `Client Followup` with description `Call client before Monday` to employee at index 2.

  ![addTask message](images/addtaskmessage.png)
* `addtask`
   shows the warning message with the correct format for `addtask` because the command is invalid.
  ![addTaskHelp message](images/addtaskhelp.png)
* `addtask 1 task/TASK_NAME_MORE_THAN_40_CHARACTERS desc/Submit by Friday`
   shows the warning message because the task name exceeds the character limit.
  ![addTaskNameTooLong message](images/addtasknametoolong.png)
* `addtask 1 task/Prepare Report desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION_MORE_THAN_120_CHARACTERS`
   shows the warning message because the task description exceeds the character limit.
  ![addTaskDescTooLong message](images/addtaskdesctoolong.png)

### Editing a task: `edittask`

Edits the name and/or description of an existing task identified by its task index.

Format:
```
edittask TASK_INDEX [task/TASK_NAME] [desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION]
```

* `TASK_INDEX` refers to the task index shown beside the task on the employee card (e.g. `#1`, `#2`).
* At least one of `task/` or `desc/` must be provided.
* Fields not provided remain unchanged.
* Duplicate prefixes are not allowed (e.g. two `task/` in one command).

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** You can edit any task using its `TASK_INDEX` index, even if the employee it belongs to is not currently shown on screen. For example, if you have used `show` to filter the list, tasks belonging to hidden employees can still be edited using their task index.

**Parameter constraints for this command:**

| Parameter          | Length                                                | Allowed Characters                                    |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `TASK_INDEX`       | – | Positive integer that exists in the current task list |
| `TASK_NAME`        | 1–40 characters                                       | Any characters                                        |
| `TASK_DESCRIPTION` | 1–120 characters                                      | Any characters                                        |

</box>


#### Examples

* `edittask 1 task/Prepare Report desc/Submit by Friday` – edits both the name and description of task `#1`.
* `edittask 2 task/Client Followup` – edits only the name of task `#2`.
* `edittask 3 desc/Submit by Friday` – edits only the description of task `#3`.

After entering a valid `edittask` command, ManageUp confirms the update and shows the edited task.

<a id="deleting-a-task"></a>
### Deleting a task : `deletetask`

Deletes one or more tasks using their displayed task indices.

Format: `deletetask INDEX [MORE_INDICES]...`

* `INDEX` refers to the task index shown beside the task on the employee card, for example `#1`.
* Each index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* You can provide multiple task indices in one command to batch delete tasks.
* When multiple task indices are provided, every task index must be valid before any task is deleted.
* Duplicate task indices in the same command are not allowed.
* `deletetask` removes the task from both the employee's personal task list and the overall task list used internally by ManageUp.
* If an invalid task index is provided, ManageUp will reject the command and no task will be deleted.
* `deletetask` provides a warning message to the user with the specified format to remind users of the correct format if the command is invalid.

Examples:
* `deletetask 1` deletes the task with task index `1`.

![Delete task success](images/DeleteTask.png)

* `deletetask 2 4` deletes the tasks with task indices `2` and `4`.

![Batch delete task success](images/BatchDeleteTask.png)

* `deletetask 0` is not valid because task indices must start from `1`.

<a id="clearing-all-tasks-for-an-employee"></a>
### Clearing all tasks for an employee : `cleartasks`

Clears every task assigned to one employee.

Format: `cleartasks INDEX` or `cleartasks n/EMPLOYEE_NAME`

* `INDEX` refers to the employee index shown in the currently displayed employee list.
* `n/EMPLOYEE_NAME` clears tasks for the uniquely matching employee name in the currently displayed employee list.
* `cleartasks` removes all tasks from both the employee's personal task list and the overall task list used internally by ManageUp.
* If the employee index is invalid, no tasks will be cleared.
* If the provided employee name does not match any displayed employee, the command will fail.
* If more than one displayed employee has the same name, the command will fail and you should use `cleartasks INDEX` instead.

Examples:
* `cleartasks 1` clears all tasks assigned to the 1st displayed employee.
* `cleartasks n/John Doe` clears all tasks assigned to employee `John Doe`.

![Clear tasks success](images/ClearTask.png)

* `cleartasks 0` is not valid because employee indices must start from `1`.

<a id="clearing-all-entries"></a>
### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

<a id="exiting-the-program"></a>
### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

<a id="saving-the-data"></a>
### Saving the data

ManageUp data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

<a id="editing-the-data-file"></a>
### Editing the data file

ManageUp data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ManageUp will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause ManageUp to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ManageUp home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
