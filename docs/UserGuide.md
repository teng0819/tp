# ManageUp User Guide

ManageUp is a **desktop app for managing employee records, optimized for use via a Line Interface**
(CLI) while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It helps teams manage employee
contact details, roles, departments, and assigned tasks more efficiently.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from the ManageUp GitHub releases page.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for ManageUp.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the
   `java -jar ManageUp.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all employees.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com d/IT pos/Software Engineer` : Adds an employee named `John Doe`.

   * `delete John Doe` : Deletes the employee named `John Doe` if the name is unique in the current list.

   * `addtask task/Prepare Report desc/Submit by Friday n/John Doe` : Adds a task to employee `John Doe`.

   * `clear` : Deletes all employees.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* `show n/Alex pos/Manager` shows employees whose name matches `Alex` and whose position matches `Manager`.

### Editing an employee : `edit`

Edits an existing employee in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [d/DEPARTMENT] [pos/POSITION] [t/TAG]...`

* Edits the employee at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the employee will be removed; adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the employee's tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email of the 1st employee.

Finds employees whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Employees matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>

### Deleting an employee : `delete`

Format: `delete NAME` or `delete INDEX`

* `delete INDEX` deletes the employee at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* `delete NAME` deletes the employee whose name matches `NAME`, ignoring case and extra spaces.
* `delete NAME` works only when exactly one employee matches the given name.
* If multiple employees share the same name, use `delete INDEX` instead.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd employee in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st employee in the results of the `find` command.
* `delete John Doe` deletes the employee named `John Doe` if the name is unique in the current list.

### Adding a task to an employee : `addtask`

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

### Saving the data

ManageUp data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ManageUp data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ManageUp will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause ManageUp to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ManageUp home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
