## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Besides employee commands such as `add`, `edit`, `delete`, and `show`, the `Logic` component also handles
task-related commands. In particular, `AddressBookParser` routes `addtask`, `edittask`, and `deletetask`
to `AddTaskCommandParser`, `EditTaskCommandParser`, and `DeleteTaskCommandParser` respectively, which then
construct `AddTaskCommand`, `EditTaskCommand`, and `DeleteTaskCommand` objects for execution by `LogicManager`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores task data in two levels:
  * each `Employee` owns an individual `TaskListStorage`, which stores the tasks shown on that employee's card in the UI.
  * the `ModelManager` also maintains a separate in-memory overall `TaskList`, which maps `Task -> Employee` and is used to locate the employee that owns a task during task editing and deletion.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

Task indices are part of the task model. Each `Task` stores a task index that is displayed beside the task on the
employee card, and commands such as `edittask` and `deletetask` operate on this task index rather than the employee
list index. Task indices are assigned when tasks are created. The overall in-memory `TaskList` is rebuilt when the
model starts, but is not currently persisted as a separate storage file.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Task management

ManageUp supports task assignment and maintenance through four task commands:

* `addtask` adds a task to a specific employee.
* `edittask` edits the name and/or description of an existing task by task index.
* `deletetask` deletes a task by task index.
* `cleartasks` removes all tasks assigned to one employee.

Task management uses both per-employee storage and a global in-memory task structure:

* `Task.java` represents a single task. Each task stores a name, description, and task index. The task index is
  displayed in the UI and is used by task-editing and task-deletion commands.
* `TaskListStorage.java` stores the list of tasks assigned to one employee. This is the task list shown on the
  employee card in the UI.
* `TaskList.java` stores an overall in-memory mapping of `Task -> Employee`. This mapping is used to locate the
  employee that owns a task when `edittask` or `deletetask` is executed.
* `UniquePersonList.java` is responsible for updating the owning employee's individual task list. When a task is
  added, edited, or deleted, the affected employee is replaced with an updated `Employee` object so that the
  observable employee list remains in sync with the UI.

#### Task index design

Task indices are shown directly on the employee card beside each task, for example `#3 Prepare Report: Submit by Friday`.
Unlike employee commands such as `edit 1` or `delete 1`, task commands use the task index instead of the employee index.

When a new task is created, the task is assigned the next available task index. This allows task commands such as
`edittask 3` and `deletetask 3` to refer to the same task regardless of which employee owns it.

#### Add task implementation

`addtask` is parsed by `AddTaskCommandParser`, which extracts the task name, task description, and employee index from
the command input before constructing an `AddTaskCommand`.

During execution:

1. `AddressBookParser` recognises the `addtask` command and delegates parsing to `AddTaskCommandParser`.
2. `AddTaskCommandParser` extracts the task name, task description, and employee index from the command input.
3.  A new `Task` is created with the extracted details and an assigned task index.
4. `AddTaskCommandParser` constructs an `AddTaskCommand` with the new `Task` and employee index.
5. `AddTaskCommand` calls `Model#addTask(task, employeeIndex)`.
6. `ModelManager` forwards the request to `AddressBook`, together with the overall in-memory `TaskList`.
7. `AddressBook` updates the overall `TaskList` to include the new task and its owning employee.
8.  The task is also updated to the employee's own `TaskListStorage`.


This two-level update ensures that the task is both visible on the employee card and discoverable by future task
commands that operate by task index.

#### Edit task implementation

`edittask` is parsed by `EditTaskCommandParser`, which reads a task index from the preamble and optional updates from
the `task/` and `desc/` prefixes.

During execution:

1. The model locates the existing task by task index using the overall `TaskList`.
2. A new replacement `Task` is created using the same task index but updated fields.
3. The task is replaced in the overall `TaskList`.
4. The same replacement is propagated to the owning employee through `UniquePersonList`.

This ensures the task remains associated with the same employee while reflecting the updated details in both model
structures.

#### Delete task implementation

`deletetask` is parsed by `DeleteTaskCommandParser`, which validates the task index before creating a
`DeleteTaskCommand`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the task-deletion flow for `deletetask 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `deletetask 1` Command" />

The deletion flow works as follows:

1. `AddressBookParser` recognises the `deletetask` command and delegates parsing to `DeleteTaskCommandParser`.
2. `DeleteTaskCommandParser` constructs a `DeleteTaskCommand` with the requested task index.
3. `DeleteTaskCommand` calls `Model#deleteTask(taskIndex)`.
4. `ModelManager` forwards the request to `AddressBook`, together with the overall in-memory `TaskList`.
5. `AddressBook` asks `TaskList` for the employee who owns the task and removes the task from the overall mapping.
6. `AddressBook` then delegates to `UniquePersonList` to remove the same task from the employee's own `TaskListStorage`.

This design allows `deletetask` to work using a task index alone, without requiring the user to specify the employee
who owns the task.

#### Clear tasks implementation

`cleartasks` is parsed by `ClearTasksCommandParser`, which accepts either an employee index or `n/NAME` before
creating a `ClearTasksCommand`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the clear-tasks flow for `cleartasks 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ClearTasksSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `cleartasks 1` Command" />

The clear-tasks flow works as follows:

1. `AddressBookParser` recognises the `cleartasks` command and delegates parsing to `ClearTasksCommandParser`.
2. `ClearTasksCommandParser` constructs a `ClearTasksCommand` using the employee index or employee name.
3. `ClearTasksCommand` resolves the target employee from the currently displayed employee list.
4. `ClearTasksCommand` calls `Model#clearTasksForPerson(employee)`.
5. `ModelManager` forwards the request to `AddressBook`, together with the overall in-memory `TaskList`.
6. `AddressBook` removes the employee's tasks from the overall `TaskList`.
7. `AddressBook` then delegates to `UniquePersonList` to clear the same employee's personal `TaskListStorage`.

This keeps the overall task mapping and the employee card in sync after all tasks for one employee are cleared.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th employee in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new employee. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `delete` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
