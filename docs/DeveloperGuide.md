## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee` objects residing in the `Model`.

The Help Window is implemented as a separate UI feature coordinated by `MainWindow`.
The class diagram below summarises the main classes involved.

<puml src="diagrams/HelpWindowClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the Help Window feature" />

`MainWindow` owns a single `HelpWindow` instance and either shows it or focuses it when the user triggers `help`.
`HelpWindow` extends `UiPart` and uses `HelpWindowContent` to obtain the formatted command reference displayed in the
popup. Before the window is shown, `MainWindow` delegates to `HelpWindowLogic` to reset fullscreen and maximized state
so that the help popup opens consistently even after earlier window-state changes.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Besides employee commands such as `add`, `edit`, `delete`, and `show`, the `Logic` component also handles
task-related commands. In particular, `AddressBookParser` routes `addtask`, `edittask`,`deletetask` and `cleartasks` commands
to `AddTaskCommandParser`, `EditTaskCommandParser`, `DeleteTaskCommandParser` and `ClearTasksCommandParser` respectively, which then
construct `AddTaskCommand`, `EditTaskCommand`, `DeleteTaskCommand` and `ClearTasksCommand` objects for execution by `LogicManager`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Employee` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Employee` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` that can be observed so that the UI
  automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores task data in two levels:
  * each `Employee` owns an individual `TaskListStorage`, which stores the tasks shown on that employee's card in the UI.
  * the `ModelManager` also maintains a separate in-memory overall `TaskList`, which maps `Task -> Employee` and is used to locate the employee that owns a task during task editing and deletion.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

Task indices are part of the task model. Each `Task` stores a task index that is displayed beside the task on the
employee card, and commands such as `edittask` and `deletetask` operate on this task index rather than the employee
list index. Task indices are assigned when tasks are created. The overall in-memory `TaskList` is rebuilt when the
model starts, but is not currently persisted as a separate storage file.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`,
which `Employee` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of
each `Employee` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Employee management

ManageUp supports adding, editing, and deleting employees. All three operations are handled through the `Logic` and `Model` components and follow a consistent parse-then-execute pattern.

#### Add employee

The `add` command creates a new employee record with the required fields: name, phone, email, department, and position. Tags are optional.

`add` is parsed by `AddCommandParser`, which tokenizes the input using the defined prefixes and validates that all mandatory prefixes are present before constructing an `AddCommand`.

During execution:

1. `LogicManager` asks `AddressBookParser` to parse the command.
2. `AddressBookParser` creates `AddCommandParser`, which builds an `Employee` object from the parsed fields and wraps it in an `AddCommand`.
3. `AddCommand` performs three duplicate checks against the model: by name (`Model#hasPerson`), by email (`Model#getEmployeeWithSameEmail`), and by phone (`Model#getEmployeeWithSamePhone`). If any check fails, a `CommandException` is thrown.
4. `AddCommand` calls `Model#addPerson(employee)`.
5. `ModelManager` delegates to `AddressBook#addPerson(employee)`, which adds the employee through `UniquePersonList`.
6. `ModelManager` resets the filtered list to show all employees.
7. A `CommandResult` is created and returned to `LogicManager`.

#### Delete employee

ManageUp supports three variants of the `delete` command:

* single employee deletion by employee index
* single employee deletion by unique employee name
* batch employee deletion by multiple employee indices

The activity diagram below shows how `DeleteCommandParser` decides which deletion mode to construct.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteEmployeeActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity diagram for parsing and executing the delete employee command" />

The parser behaves as follows:

1. If the trimmed input is empty, parsing fails with the standard command-usage message.
2. If the input contains multiple whitespace-separated tokens and every token is a positive integer, the parser treats
   the command as batch deletion by indices.
3. If the input contains a single positive integer token, the parser treats the command as single-index deletion.
4. Otherwise, the parser treats the full input as a name-based deletion request and validates the employee name format.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the runtime interactions for the representative single-index flow `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic and Model components for the `delete 1` command" />

During execution:

1. `LogicManager` asks `AddressBookParser` to parse the command.
2. `AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteCommandParser`, which constructs a `DeleteCommand`.
3. `DeleteCommand` calls `Model#deletePerson(employee)`.
4. `ModelManager` first removes all tasks belonging to that employee from the overall in-memory `TaskList`.
5. `ModelManager` then delegates to `AddressBook` to remove the employee from the address book.
6. `AddressBook` removes the employee through `UniquePersonList`.
7. A `CommandResult` is created and returned to `LogicManager`.

Batch deletion follows the same deletion logic after validation, except that all requested indices are first checked,
then deleted in descending order to avoid index-shifting issues in the filtered employee list.

For name-based deletion, `DeleteCommand` normalizes the requested name, matches it against the currently displayed
employee list, and rejects cases where there are zero matches or more than one match.

### Task management

ManageUp supports task assignment and maintenance through four task commands:

* `addtask` adds a task to a specific employee.
* `edittask` edits the name and/or description of an existing task by task index.
* `deletetask` deletes a task by task index.
* `cleartasks` removes all tasks assigned to one employee.

Task management uses both per-employee storage and a global in-memory task structure:

* `Task.java` represents a single task. Each task stores a name, description, and task index. The task index is
  displayed in the UI and is used by task-editing and task-deletion commands.
* `TaskListStorage.java` stores the list of tasks assigned to one employee. This is the task list shown on the
  employee card in the UI.
* `TaskList.java` stores an overall in-memory mapping of `Task -> Employee`. This mapping is used to locate the
  employee that owns a task when `edittask` or `deletetask` is executed.
* `UniquePersonList.java` is responsible for updating the owning employee's individual task list. When a task is
  added, edited, or deleted, the affected employee is replaced with an updated `Employee` object so that the
  observable employee list remains in sync with the UI.

#### Task index design

Task indices are shown directly on the employee card beside each task, for example `#3 Prepare Report: Submit by Friday`.
Unlike employee commands such as `edit 1` or `delete 1`, task commands use the task index instead of the employee index.

When a new task is created, the task is assigned the next available task index. This allows task commands such as
`edittask 3` and `deletetask 3` to refer to the same task regardless of which employee owns it.

Task indices are intentionally not renumbered after deletions. This is a deliberate design choice to keep task
references stable once they have been shown to the user. If task indices were reassigned whenever some other task was
deleted, a command such as `edittask 8` could end up referring to a different task from the one the user previously
saw, which would make task operations harder to reason about and easier to misuse.

This design trades compact numbering for consistency. Over time, task indices can become sparse and larger than the
current number of tasks, but for ManageUp's expected usage scale, stable task references are more valuable than
perfectly consecutive numbering. If the application is extended to support substantially larger long-term task volumes,
the team can revisit this design and consider alternative identifier schemes that preserve both uniqueness and
usability.

If ManageUp is extended to support substantially larger long-term task volumes, a more scalable refinement would be to
separate internal task identity from user-facing display order. Each task can keep a stable internal identifier for
storage and updates, while the UI presents a smaller context-specific display number to the user. This preserves
reliable task tracking internally while avoiding unwieldy visible task numbers in long-running usage.

#### Add task implementation

`addtask` is parsed by `AddTaskCommandParser`, which extracts the task name, task description, and employee index from
the command input before constructing an `AddTaskCommand`.

During execution:

1. `AddressBookParser` recognises the `addtask` command and delegates parsing to `AddTaskCommandParser`.
2. `AddTaskCommandParser` extracts the task name, task description, and employee index from the command input.
3.  A new `Task` is created with the extracted details and an assigned task index.
4. `AddTaskCommandParser` constructs an `AddTaskCommand` with the new `Task` and employee index.
5. `AddTaskCommand` calls `Model#addTask(task, employeeIndex)`.
6. `ModelManager` forwards the request to `AddressBook`, together with the overall in-memory `TaskList`.
7. `AddressBook` updates the overall `TaskList` to include the new task and its owning employee.
8.  The task is also updated to the employee's own `TaskListStorage`.


This two-level update ensures that the task is both visible on the employee card and discoverable by future task
commands that operate by task index.

#### Edit task implementation

`edittask` is parsed by `EditTaskCommandParser`, which reads a task index from the preamble and optional updates from
the `task/` and `desc/` prefixes.

During execution:

1. The model locates the existing task by task index using the overall `TaskList`.
2. A new replacement `Task` is created using the same task index but updated fields.
3. The task is replaced in the overall `TaskList`.
4. The same replacement is propagated to the owning employee through `UniquePersonList`.

This ensures the task remains associated with the same employee while reflecting the updated details in both model
structures.

#### Delete task implementation

`deletetask` is parsed by `DeleteTaskCommandParser`, which validates the task index before creating a
`DeleteTaskCommand`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the task-deletion flow for `deletetask 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `deletetask 1` Command" />

The deletion flow works as follows:

1. `AddressBookParser` recognises the `deletetask` command and delegates parsing to `DeleteTaskCommandParser`.
2. `DeleteTaskCommandParser` constructs a `DeleteTaskCommand` with the requested task index.
3. `DeleteTaskCommand` calls `Model#deleteTask(taskIndex)`.
4. `ModelManager` forwards the request to `AddressBook`, together with the overall in-memory `TaskList`.
5. `AddressBook` asks `TaskList` for the employee who owns the task and removes the task from the overall mapping.
6. `AddressBook` then delegates to `UniquePersonList` to remove the same task from the employee's own `TaskListStorage`.

This design allows `deletetask` to work using a task index alone, without requiring the user to specify the employee
who owns the task.

#### Clear tasks implementation

`cleartasks` is parsed by `ClearTasksCommandParser`, which accepts either an employee index or `n/NAME` before
creating a `ClearTasksCommand`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the clear-tasks flow for `cleartasks 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ClearTasksSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic and Model Components for the `cleartasks 1` Command" />

The clear-tasks flow works as follows:

1. `AddressBookParser` recognises the `cleartasks` command and delegates parsing to `ClearTasksCommandParser`.
2. `ClearTasksCommandParser` constructs a `ClearTasksCommand` using the employee index or employee name.
3. `ClearTasksCommand` resolves the target employee from the currently displayed employee list.
4. `ClearTasksCommand` calls `Model#clearTasksForPerson(employee)`.
5. `ModelManager` forwards the request to `AddressBook`, together with the overall in-memory `TaskList`.
6. `AddressBook` removes the employee's tasks from the overall `TaskList`.
7. `AddressBook` then delegates to `UniquePersonList` to clear the same employee's personal `TaskListStorage`.

This keeps the overall task mapping and the employee card in sync after all tasks for one employee are cleared.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Given below are some planned enhancements that the team may implement in future iterations.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

Undo/redo is a plausible future enhancement because the app already
supports several data-mutating commands such as `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `addtask`, `edittask`, and `deletetask`.

One possible implementation is to introduce a `VersionedAddressBook` that extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and a `currentStatePointer`. The proposed class would support
the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

If this feature is implemented, the corresponding operations can be exposed through the `Model` interface as
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`, and `Model#redoAddressBook()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism would behave at each step.

Step 1. The user would launch the application for the first time. The proposed `VersionedAddressBook` is initialized with
the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` points to that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th employee in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new employee. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user decides that adding the employee was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command would do the opposite — it would call `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the employee being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

This proposal prioritizes implementation simplicity. If the team decides to build undo/redo in future, the main tradeoff
to revisit is whether full-state snapshots remain acceptable as the amount of employee and task data grows.





## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder.

   2. Open Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the jar file using `cd`, and run `java -jar ManageUp.jar`.<br>
      Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample employees. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   5. Test case: `add n/Jane Doe p/98765432 e/jane@example.com d/HR pos/Manager` (where `98765432` already belongs to another employee)<br>
      Expected: No employee is added. Error message indicating a duplicate phone number is shown in the status message.

   6. Test case: `add n/Jane Doe p/87654321 e/johnd@example.com d/HR pos/Manager` (where `johnd@example.com` already belongs to another employee)<br>
      Expected: No employee is added. Error message indicating a duplicate email is shown in the status message.

   7. Test case: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com d/Engineering` (missing `pos/` prefix)<br>
      Expected: No employee is added. Error message showing the correct command format is displayed.

   8. Other incorrect add commands to try: `add`, `add n/John`, `add n/ p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com d/Engineering pos/Developer` (blank name)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Adding a task

1. Adding a task to an employee

   1. Prerequisites: List all employees using the `list` command. At least one employee in the list.

   2. Test case: `addtask 1 task/Prepare Report desc/Submit the Q3 report by Friday`<br>
      Expected: A task named "Prepare Report" with description "Submit the Q3 report by Friday" is added to the first employee's card. The success message with the task details is shown in the status message. A task index (e.g. `#1`) is displayed beside the task on the employee card.

   3. Test case: `addtask 1 task/Prepare Report desc/Submit the Q3 report by Friday` (same task again, on the same employee)<br>
      Expected: No task is added. Error message indicating a duplicate task is shown in the status message.

   4. Test case: `addtask 0 task/Prepare Report desc/Submit by Friday`<br>
      Expected: No task is added. Error message indicating an invalid employee index is shown in the status message.

   5. Test case: `addtask 999 task/Prepare Report desc/Submit by Friday` (where 999 is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: No task is added. Error message indicating an invalid employee index is shown in the status message.

   6. Test case: `addtask 1 task/Prepare Report` (missing `desc/` prefix)<br>
      Expected: No task is added. Error message showing the correct command format is displayed.

   7. Test case: `addtask 1 task/ desc/Some description` (blank task name)<br>
      Expected: No task is added. Error message indicating invalid task name is shown.

   8. Other incorrect addtask commands to try: `addtask`, `addtask 1`, `addtask abc task/Name desc/Desc`<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Deleting an employee

1. Deleting an employee while all employees are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all employees using the `list` command. Multiple employees in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First employee is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted employee shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `delete Alex Yeoh`<br>
      Expected: The employee named Alex Yeoh is deleted from the current list. Details of the deleted employee are shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   4. Test case: `delete 1 3`<br>
      Expected: Both employees are deleted from the list in a single command. Details of the deleted employees shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   5. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No employee is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   6. Test case: `delete 2 2`<br>
      Expected: No employee is deleted. Error details shown in the status message because duplicate indexes are not allowed.

   7. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Open the data file at `data/addressbook.json` and edit it manually.

   1. Invalid JSON example:
      delete a closing brace from the file and launch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with an empty address book, and an error is reported in the logs indicating that the
      data file could not be loaded correctly.

   1. Invalid value example:
      change a phone number to an invalid value such as `abc` and launch the app.<br>
      Expected: The app starts with an empty address book, and an error is reported in the logs.
